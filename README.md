# Machine-Learning-Sandbox
CD2H Tool and Cloud Core Project

Project Lead: Peter Robinson (Jackson Laboratory) 
Project participants: Heidi Spratt (Univ of Texas), Juan Banda (Georgia State), Freimuth (Mayo), Chunua Weng (Columbia), Sana Sayed and Donald Brown (UVA), Larry Hunter (UColorado), Andrew Williams. Amy Yates (OHSU), Chris Chute (Johns Hopkins University), Justin Guinney (Sage Bionetworks), Philip Payne (WUSTL) 

This proposal addresses four pressing roadblocks for clinical ML: 
Accessing clinical data and preparing the data for ML
Implementing state-of-the-art ML algorithms for use with clinical data
Avoiding sources of bias specific to clinical data
Reproducibility, documentation and transparency of ML tools. 
Clinical AI Best Practices Platform (CABP) will provide community-vetted solutions, host modular pipelines using openly available synthetic data and protected datasets with a common data access procedure hosted by NCATS. 
CABP will accelerate progress in the development of, use, and standardization of ML tools in clinical care by providing best-practice examples and allowing developers to easily assess the performance of new algorithms by leveraging the modular architecture of CABP.
Deliverables: Questionnaire, white paper on requirements and best practices, technical specifications and prototype Python code for exemplar clinical ML project implemented and tested on CABP platform.

Get involved! We want your ideas, your tools and algorithms, and your evaluation.
